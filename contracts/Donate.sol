There are no “backdoors” that can allow the contract author or deployer to withdraw ether without going through the contract’s exposed functions. This is one fundamental reason why a well-written contract can be trusted to handle ether on behalf of users—the users can see the code and, therefore, the means by which owned ether will be used by the contract.
